# vietspotifun
A Spotify API data exploration project to analyse music consumption trend of Vietnamese market.

## Background
I saw many such projects for predominantly English-speaking countries. As music streaming services, especially Spotify, become increasingly popular in Vietnam, I took it upon myself to answer some questions and debunk myths that has always surrounded the music scene, with the help of Spotify's web API and Python. 

## Methods
I used the Python library Spotipy to assist fetching data from Spotify. I also wrote some helper functions ([user_util.py](https://github.com/malajvan/vietspotifun/blob/main/user_util.py) and [artist_util.py](https://github.com/malajvan/vietspotifun/blob/main/artist_util.py)) to assist getting and compiling desirable data with pandas. For data visualization, I used matplotlib library to create graphs and plots to demonstrate my findings in [plottings.py](https://github.com/malajvan/vietspotifun/blob/main/plottings.py).
